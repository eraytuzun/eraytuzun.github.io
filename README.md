# How to make changes?

- **Set Up CodeSpace**: If you haven't already, create a new CodeSpace or use an existing one.

- **Open Terminal**: Once your CodeSpace is ready, you'll see a terminal. If it's not open, you can open a new terminal window.

- **Install Dependencies**: If you're using a newly created CodeSpace, you need to install dependencies. Run the command `npm install` in the terminal.

- **Make Changes**: Make necessary changes to your code.

- **Test Locally**: After making changes, run `npm start` in the terminal. This will start your application on your localhost, and a new window will open automatically in your browser to preview the changes.

- **Commit Changes**: Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit them to your GitHub repository. Do not forget to enter a commit message.

- **Sync with GitHub**: Click sync button to sync with GitHub. This will push your changes to your GitHub repository.

- **Deploy Changes**: Open a new terminal window and enter `npm run deploy`. This command will deploy your changes live.

- **Stop CodeSpace**: After you're done working, don't forget to stop your CodeSpace. This helps save resources. You can stop it by closing the browser window or using the stop button provided.

        title: 'Assessment and Improvement of Process Smells in Software Development',
        description: 'Our research in this area focuses on identifying, classifying, and mitigating process smells within software development environments. Process smells, akin to code smells, are indicators of potential inefficiencies or problems in software development workflows that, if addressed, can significantly enhance the quality and speed of software production. Through empirical analysis and the development of taxonomies for inline comments and bug-tracking process smells, we provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of these inefficiencies. Our goal is to offer actionable strategies for software teams to improve their development processes, thereby leading to more effective project management and enhanced software quality.',

        title: 'Validity and Reliability of Ground Truth in Software Engineering Research',
        description: 'This area of research scrutinizes the foundation upon which software engineering research is often built—the ground truth data used in empirical studies, particularly in code reviewer recommendations and bug-tracking systems. We challenge the accuracy and reliability of these foundational datasets, highlighting the potential for biases and inaccuracies that can significantly impact the outcomes of research studies. By investigating the validity of ground truth in software engineering and applying blockchain technology to improve process integrity, our work calls for a critical examination of empirical data sources. We aim to establish methodologies that ensure the robustness and reliability of ground truth data, thereby enhancing the credibility and generalizability of research findings in software engineering.',

        title: 'Leveraging Artifact Traceability for Enhanced Software Engineering Practices',
        description: 'In this research stream, we delve into the utilization of artifact traceability graphs as a means to improve various aspects of software engineering practices, from reviewer recommendations to the identification of key developers. Artifact traceability, the ability to link and follow the life of software artifacts across the development lifecycle, presents a rich opportunity to enhance collaboration, quality assurance, and project management. Our studies demonstrate how traceability graphs can be employed to provide insights into developer contributions, facilitate more effective code reviews, and support the management of development processes. By advancing the methods and tools for leveraging artifact traceability, we contribute to the development of more coherent, efficient, and manageable software engineering projects.',
